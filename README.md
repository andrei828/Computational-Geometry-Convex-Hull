# Computational-Geometry-Convex-Hull
This is a visualisation of the convex hull calculation with multiple algorithms developed in javascript with p5.

> **Note:**  Currently only the Graham scan algorithm is implemented but Jarvis's implementation will be added soon.

The computation takes place on the client side. The Graham scan has an **nlogn complexity** and Jarvis algorithm has **n * h complexity** (where n is the number of points and h is the number of points on the convex hull).
